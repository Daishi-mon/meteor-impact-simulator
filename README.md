# meteor-impact-simulator
The Meteor Impact Simulation System models meteor impacts using Python, HTML, and JavaScript. It estimates destruction, affected areas, and casualties based on meteor data like size and speed. The project helps scientists and decision-makers assess risks, plan mitigation, and raise public awareness about meteor threats.

How to use our program 101:

The plays chosen are:
	- Script 1: The Life and Death of Julius Caesar
	- Script 2: As You Like It

DO NOTE for each classes it will not compile, since this needs the GUI to perform. But ShakespeareAnalyzer, ShakespeareAnalysis, and ScriptComparer will compile since all the contents are there only those 3 can run the outputs needed. the other are just subclasses for the main classes to work.


- First of all you will be in the MAIN GUI(SecondFrame). You need to pick Between Button A and Button B.

- Button A brings you to another GUI, that shows and read the original file for Script 1 and 2. This also has the PROTAGONIST Button.

- Button B brings you to the main assignment part, where you will see WORD COUNTER 1 and 2 this reads the script 1 word stops. WORD COUNTER 2 reads from Script 2. Then we have Script 1 and 2 Buttons.
	- Script 1 and 2, Shows the Title, Total of Protagonist, List of Protagonist in order appearance, acts, scenes, Main Location, and Protagonist speech length and turns.

- SCRIPT COMPARER Button: This just compares play A and B(Script 1 and 2).

- Save and load buttons are there to save what you reorganized and load them after.
